# 🚨 EMERGENCY FORCE REDEPLOY - December 13, 2025, 7:24 AM IST

## ISSUE
Render stuck on v4.0.0 with 4 agents despite v4.1 code with 24+ agents on main branch

## TRIGGER
This file was committed to force Render to:
1. Detect new commit
2. Clear build cache
3. Rebuild container from scratch
4. Deploy fresh image

## EXPECTED RESULT
- Render rebuilds immediately
- v4.1 code with all AI Firm components loads
- 24+ agents become available
- Backend returns version: 4.1.0
- Frontend shows all 5 departments

## FILES DEPLOYED
- backend/main.py (v4.6 diagnostic mode)
- backend/ai_firm/*.py (24+ agent system)
- backend/services/*.py (market data services)

## DEPLOYMENT TIME
~3-5 minutes from commit push

## VERIFICATION
After deploy:
curl https://yantrax-backend.onrender.com/ | jq '.components.total_agents'
# Should show: 24

## STATUS
