# YantraX RL

YantraX RL is an AI-driven trading system that integrates Reinforcement Learning (RL) with various market data services and an AI firm component. The system is designed to make intelligent trading decisions based on real-time market data and an advanced RL agent.

## Project Structure

This repository contains two main components:

*   **`backend/`**: A Python Flask application that handles market data integration, RL agent training and inference, AI firm operations, and API services.
*   **`frontend/`**: A React application built with Vite and TailwindCSS, providing a dashboard for real-time market data, agent status, portfolio metrics, and trading signals.

## Getting Started

Further instructions for setting up and running the project will be provided in subsequent updates.
